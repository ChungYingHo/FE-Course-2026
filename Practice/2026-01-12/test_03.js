// Problem Description
// You are going to create a simple timer that counts seconds.

// Objective
// Practice using setInterval() and clearInterval().

// Task
// 1. Create a variable called secs and set its initial value to 0.
// 2. Use setInterval() to run a function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
// 3. Inside the function, print the current value of secs to the console,
//    then increase secs by 1.
// 4. When secs becomes greater than 10, stop the timer using clearInterval().

let secs = 0
